# RPC Bot Server
____________________

The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Bot Server is a queue-based system designed for managing and executing procedures across
multiple remote machines. This server serves as the primary controller, queuing and delegating procedures to be run on
various machines, facilitating a streamlined and efficient approach to distributed procedure execution.

Its queue-based architecture maintains a FIFO (First In, First Out) execution order, providing an organized way to
control remote procedures. With the RPC Bot Server, you can efficiently monitor and orchestrate procedure execution
across your networked environment.

## Key Features:
* Distributed Procedure Execution: Handle and perform tasks across numerous remote machines from a centralized location.
* Queue-Based System: Procedure requests are managed in a FIFO manner, ensuring systematic and orderly execution.
* Scalability: Easily accommodate additional machines within your network to widen procedure distribution.
* Efficiency and Reliability: Eliminates the necessity for manual intervention, reducing time and potential for errors.

This project is a vital component of the RPC Bot system. For the client-side component that resides on the remote
machines, please refer to the RPC Bot Client repository.
